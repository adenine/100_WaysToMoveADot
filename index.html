<p>The first way that I often see students understand how to move a dot from one position to another is to find the destination points coordinates and jump directly to that position. This doesn't make for a very exciting animation because this jump happens in a single frame. Let's explore other methods...</p>

<p>So if we want to move the dot the next step would be to understand where the destination dot is and move some percent of the way to the destination per frame of animation. We can later the percent it moves each time to give the effect of the dot seeming to move at different speeds. This method, though simple, creates an interesting emergent behavior which is that the dot appears to move more slowly as it reaches the destination dot. This makes sense because though the percent of movement stays the same that percentage represents less movement as it gets closer to the destination.</p>

<p>So if we want the dot to move at a steady pace we will need to do a bit more work. This method has us using the Pythagorean Theorum to understand how to move at a steady speed towards the destination.</p>
